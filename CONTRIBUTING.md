## Contributing Guidelines
--------------------------

First off, thank you for considering contributing to D-Analyst. It's people like you that make D-Analyst such a great tool.

Following these guidelines help to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

D-Analyst is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community - you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into D-Analyst itself.

# Ground Rules
--------------

Responsibilties
    - Ensure cross-platform compatability for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian and Ubuntu Linux.
    - Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make.
    Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
    - Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
    - Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
    - Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more information.

# Your First Contribution
-------------------------

Unsure where to begin contributing to D-Analyst? You can start by looking for beginner friendly issue. Beginner issues are issues which should only require a few lines of code or maybe no code at all. An example of beginner friendly issues is a typographical/grammatical error in the docs, ReadMe or any other text document.

Working on your first pull request? Here are a couple of friendly tutorials.
    - [makeapullrequest.com](http://www.makeapullrequest.com/)
    - [firsttimersonly.com](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help everyone is a beginner at first ;)

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge

# Getting Started
-----------------

For something that is bigger than a one or two llne fix:
    1. Create your own fork of the code.
    2. Do the changes in your fork.
    3. if you like the change and think the project could use it: * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project. * Send a pull request.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the changes does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
    - Spelling / grammar fixes.
    - Typo correction, white space and formatting changes.
    - Comment clean up
    - Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants.
    - Adding Logging messages or debugging output
    - Changes to 'metadata' files.
    - Moving source files from one directory or package to another.

# How to report a bug.
----------------------

if you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email `adeoluwaagbakosi@gmail.com` instead.

When filling an issue make sure to answer these five questions:
    1. What version of this software an i using.
    2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
    3. What did you do?
    4. What did you expect to see?
    5. What did you see instead?
General question should be sent to the maintaners instead of the issue tracker. Your question will be answered or you will be asked to open an issue if you found a bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement.
------------------------------------------

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in D-Analyst, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on Github which describes the feature you would like to see , why you need it and how it should work.
